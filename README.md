# Data Science Capstone Research

## This repo contains the code used for my M.S. Capstone Project at GWU.  

#This project used stop-frame images from videos to identify the prescene of Varroa Mites on Honey Bees. DATS6501_DanielStevens.py includes exploratory data analysis, construction of a multilayer perceptron & convolutional neural network (Keras) and some simple visualizations. A copy of the detailed research can be provided upon request.
